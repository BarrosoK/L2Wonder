Thank you kind warrior for lending us your strength. These are dark times that we now face, finding champions is not easy task but once they do appear you must slain them fast. Collecting all their fangs is no easy tasks, monsters to hunt: Transformed mobs into <font color="LEVEL">Champions</font> Fight them hard and gather <font color="LEVEL">100 Champions Fangs</font> and as proof of your troubles you shall be rewarded once you come back to me.
